## Update Information
- **[2024/04/28]** Released **XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B-Chat** MoE chat model.
- **[2024/04/02]** Released **XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B** MoE base model, the Chat version model will be released later.

## Model Introduction

**XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B-Chat** is the aligned version of model **XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B**.

**XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B** is a multilingual large language model, independently developed by Shenzhen Yuanxiang Technology which is using Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. The total parameter scale of the model is 25.8 billion, with an actual number of activated parameters being 4.2 billion. The models released this time is the base model **XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B**. Its key features are as follows:

- **Model Structure**: XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B uses the mainstream Decoder-only Transformer network structure that extends the FFN layer of dense models to expert layers. Unlike traditional MoE model where each expert has the same size as standard FFN (such as Mixtral 8x7B), it uses more fine-grained experts, with each expert being 1/4 the size of a standard FFN. It includes shared experts and non-shared experts, where shared experts are always activated during computation, and non-shared experts are selectively activated through a Router.
- **Training Data**: The model has been thoroughly trained on a diversified and high-quality dataset consisting of 2.7 trillion of tokens, including more than 40 languages such as Chinese, English, Russian, and Spanish. The sampling ratio of different types of data is finely set, which makes the performance of Chinese and English excellent, and also takes into account the effect of other languages; The model is trained using training samples of length 8k.
- **Training Framework**: We conducted in-depth customized optimization for the unique expert routing and weight calculation logic in the MoE model, developed an efficient fusion operator to improve computational efficiency. At the same time, to address the challenges of high memory consumption and communication volume in the MoE model, we designed a processing method for overlapping computation, communication, and CPU-Offload to increase overall throughput.

The models sizes, architectures and learning rate of **XVERSE-MoE-A4.2B** are showed as follows:

## Model Evaluation

To comprehensively assess the performance of the model, we conducted extensive testing across a range of standard datasets, including C-Eval, CMMLU, Gaokao-Bench, MMLU, AGIEval, RACE-M, CommonSenseQA, PIQA, GSM8K and HumanEval. These evaluations spanned multiple capabilities of the model, specifically including Chinese question answering, English question answering, language comprehension, common sense questioning, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and coding ability. The results of the evaluations are as follows:
